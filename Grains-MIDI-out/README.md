# GRAINS "Midi out"
an alternative Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves (using a samplerate-driven framework) 
providing the option to send out MIDI control values via USB

To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS

Thanks for explanations and examples regarding:

Example-Code for Arduino-realtime-audio-processing from KHM, cologne Germany

* __Demotrack__ for Grains 'ByteBeat-Xfade' is available here: https://soundcloud.com/taitekatto/grains-midi-out

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: Send out as MIDI CC 21
* IN2 / Pot2: Send out as MIDI CC 22
* IN3:        Send out as MIDI CC 23
* Pot3:       Send out as MIDI CC 24
* A:          Send out as MIDI CC 25

__Outputs__

* OUT:        (unused so far)
* D:          (unused so far)

## Notes

The Atmega processor used in GRAINS is not capable to send out MIDI via USB directly, but luckily serial data can be converted to MIDI easily
A popular way to do this is "Hairless MIDI<->Serial Bridge", download and documentary for MacOS/Windows/Linux available here:
https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/

* If you want to use this MIDI data as input for your DAW on your PC you will need a MIDI-loopback device in software or route MIDI-out to MIDI-in with your hardware
* Please make sure to close Hairless MIDI when you want to upload this Firmware to GRAINS (uses the same USB-Serial-Port)
* You can use up to 5 pots to send out MIDI CC for instance by setting 2ATT/CV to 5V and sending the votages to IN3 and A (analogue input)
* Attaching controls in your DAW can be a bit tricky: set all knobs to 0 and only dial in one pot to max and back to zero at a time

To avoid the complexity of additional libraries, we use our own midi_sendControlChange() method here instead of the standard MIDI.sendControlChange().
If you want to extend MIDI-capabilities you may want to change this by installing the Arduino MIDI-Library and change this accordingly!
