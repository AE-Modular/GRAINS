# GRAINS "Midi out"
an alternative Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves (using a samplerate-driven framework) 
providing the option to send out CVs and/or POTs as MIDI-CC values via MIDI-out over USB. 

As a bonus also MIDI-in over USB can be used to convert any MIDI-Key on/off to Gate and any MIDI-CC to CV for GRAINS

To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: Send out as MIDI CC 21
* IN2 / Pot2: Send out as MIDI CC 22
* IN3:        Send out as MIDI CC 23
* Pot3:       Send out as MIDI CC 24
* A:          Send out as MIDI CC 25

__Outputs__

* OUT:        CV value - will reflect the intensity of any controller data sent to GRAINS' MIDI in via USB (Hairless MIDI see below)
* D:          Gate on/off - will be on for any key pressed, will be off for any key released sent to GRAINS' MIDI in via USB (Hairless MIDI see below)

## Notes

The Atmega processor used in GRAINS is not capable of sending out MIDI via USB directly, but luckily serial data can be converted to MIDI easily.
A popular way to do this is the free software "Hairless MIDI<->Serial Bridge". Software and documentation for MacOS/Windows/Linux can be downloaded here:
https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial

* If you want to use this MIDI data as input for your DAW on your PC you will need a MIDI-loopback device in software or route MIDI-out to MIDI-in with your hardware
* Please make sure to close Hairless MIDI when you want to upload this Firmware to GRAINS (uses the same USB-Serial-Port)
* You can use up to 5 pots to send out MIDI CC for instance by setting 2ATT/CV to 5V and sending the votages to IN3 and A (analogue input)
* Attaching controls in your DAW can be a bit tricky: set all knobs to 0 and only dial in one pot to max and back to zero at a time

* As an extra also MIDI-in will be processed: any key pressed will trigger a Gate via digital out
* Any Controller-Data sent to GRAINS (via Hairless MIDI or similar) will generate CV via analog out 
* In terms of performance please avoid unnecessary MIDI-data, for instance clock-signals should be avoided to be sent via Hairless Midi, here

* The so called Midi "running status" is recognized on input, but not used on output, so this firmware should be compatible with any MIDI-hardware or software.

To avoid the complexity of additional libraries, we use our own midi_sendControlChange() method here instead of the standard MIDI.sendControlChange(). MIDI-inut is processed directly as incoming serial data.
If you want to extend MIDI-capabilities you may want to change this by installing the Arduino MIDI-Library and change this accordingly!
