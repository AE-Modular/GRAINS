# "Scheveningen" 

An alternative Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves

https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p86/GRAINS.html

This is a modern take on West Coast Synthesis made in The Hague by Kassen Oud (https://www.facebook.com/kassen.oud)
  
To set up the environment needed to install this firmware, please refer to the AeManual for GRAINS on the AE Modular Wiki: http://wiki.aemodular.com/pmwiki.php/AeManual/GRAINS
 
## Note

This firmware works, but there are still a few things that can be improved. Please play around with it and post your comments on the forum at

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: Controls gain which goes quickly into distortion, if controlled via CV the Pot will control the depth of CV control 
* IN2 / Pot2: Controls an internal Wavefolder, if controlled via CV the Pot will control the depth of CV control 
* IN3 / Pot3: Controls the pitch of the oscillator, if controlled via CV the pot will add to the CV pitch

__Outputs__

* OUT:        Audio out of the oscillator

__Caution!__ Use at your own risk  (according to GNU General Public License v2 '12. No Warrenty')

This program in combination with the hardware it is applied to can produce harsh and loud 
frequencies that may be of harm to speakers or your ears! Permanent hearing loss may result 
from exposure to sound at high volumes. Use as low a volume as possible.
