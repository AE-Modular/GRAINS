# GRAINS Morse-code

Morsecode playback can be started and then will be played back in a loop or play once.

On startup the Morsecode for "AEM" (AE Modular) will be sent out as Gate-events via GRAINS' digital output. 
To hear this, for instance sent digital out to 2VCA and any Oscillator to the same VCA as audio-material.

To change the initial Morse-Message please search for "###" and adjust the string to your liking!

To enter new morsecodes (in realtime!) connect a MIDI-Keyboard and Connect Bus-Gate with IN1, Bus-CV with IN3.

As an intial setup: "Shortcut" audio-out with audio-in, Set P1 to IN1 and max position. Set P2 to MAN and max position. Set P3 to min postion.
The Morsecode itself can be modified and/or overwritten as explained further below.
  
Of course the Gate-events can be used for any other usecase, like triggering 2ENV, KICK, DRUMKIT or whatever.
Even usage as a Clock-Signal may be considered for creative use!

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: Gate to trigger new letter (select IN1 and put P2 to max!)
* IN2 / Pot2: Stop Morsecode if all left, Play once in middle-position, loop Morsecode when turned to max (select MAN for P2!)
* IN3:        Select letter (Note CV)     // Two upper octaves C#: '.', F#: '-', c#: word pause, g#: delete last character
* A:          Clock input (Yes, we use the audio-inut for clock-in, here!)
* Pot3:       Beat Devider (changes speed, max speed [== default] when all left).

__Outputs__

* OUT:        Puts out a steady-rate clock-signal, use this to "shortcut" with audio-in, if you don't want to use an LFO or Bus-Clock as your clock!
* D:          Gate to trigger Morsecode on Output (connect to 2VCA for instance)


## IMPORTANT:  

Please select IN1 as input and IN2 as manual, Then set Pot1 and Pot2 to their maximum value!
Otherwise Gate-Tracking and playback of Morse-Code may not work as intended! You may change Pot2 to restart or pause the Morse-Code lateron!
   

## Notes

To learn about Morsecode and see the table of Morse-characters you could put in, please refer to: 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code
As initial Content the String "AEM" for AE Modular will be played back as morse code
Similar to putting in real morse code, there will be no error-checking, so if you want you can invent your own, new morse-characters ;-)
  
Use keys of lowest 2 octaves to change content to be sent out as Morsecode to Digital-Out as Gate-CV:

C# (or C) enter a new DIT (short morse character) - second-highest octave

F# (or G) enter a new DAH (long morse character) - second-highest octave

c# (or c) enter a PAUSE - (should not be more than one at a time) highest octave

f# (or g) delete last morse-character (DIT, DAH or PAUSE) - highest octave

Please note: in contrast to a Computer-Keyboard we have _no_ autorepeat for entering of keys, Morsedigits or pauses that is!
-> To better understand what is happening here, we recommend you to enable the Serial Monitor from the Arduino IDE (CTRL/CMD+SHIFT+M)
