# 'GRAINS Evelope Follower' / 'VU-Meter'  
an experimental Firmware for the AE Modular GRAINS module by tangible waves https://www.tangiblewaves.com (using a samplerate-driven framework).
https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p86/GRAINS.html
  
* __Demotrack__ for Grains 'Palindrome' is available here: https://soundcloud.com/taitekatto/grains-envelopefollower

# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* IN1 / Pot1: (unused so far)
* IN2 / Pot2: Select quantisation for audio-in measurement
* IN3:        (unused so far)
* Pot3:       amplification of CV measured at audio-in
* A:          audio-in

__Outputs__
  
* OUT:        CV as "sampled" and "quantized" from audio-in, to be used as a kind of VU-Meter / Envelope-Follower output
* D:          (unused so far)

## Notes

* The algorithm used here to do the envelope-following is optimized to be as fast as possible
* In fact the way the envelope-detection is working here, is more like a VU-meter
* It works quite well with rhythmical content, for slowly evolving sounds prefilering may be helpful, please experiment ;-)
