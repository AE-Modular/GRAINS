# Usage of this Firmware with GRAINS:

__Inputs__

* A:          Audio input
* IN1 / Pot1: Shift Phase: To get a Phaser-effect please modulate with an LFO (slow triangle for the well know effect)
* IN2 / Pot2: Frequency of sine for RingMod, or sine itself, if no signal on input or PitchShift
* IN3:        BitCrusher/BitClipper: set amount from 0 to 7 (8 to 1 bit)
* Pot3:       Modeselector: Different routings and options of differnet effects, from left to right:
 
              Mode 1: Audio->RingMod->PhaseShifter->BitCrusher                    
              Mode 2: Audio->WaveFolder->RingMod->BitCrusher->PhaseShifter
              Mode 3: Audio->PitchShift->BitClip->PhaseShifter                                                  
              Mode 4: SineWave->BitClip->PhaseShifter                                                   
              Mode 5: Audio->BitCrusher->PitchShifter->BitCrusher (here IN2/Pot2 will modulate the first BitCrusher)

__Outputs__

* OUT:        Audio out 
* D:          HIGH if audio-Signal is above zero, LOW if not

## Notes

* We highly recommend to try out Ringmod with the SquareWave from OSC - if you twist the PULSEWIDTH knob all way up you can get interesting mixes of the sine used for RingMod and the ringmodulated signal
* Good results for phasing can be obtained for instance with a slow triangle to IN1, to get fast percussive results you may use a squarewave instead
* Intersting BitCrushing/BitClipping sequences can be applied with an LFO and/or TRIQ164 to IN3
* If you want to turn BitCrushing/BitClipping on/off or manually select the amount of BitCrushing/BitClipping you may use 2ATT/CV for instance
* Modulating the Frequency of the SineWave/Ringmod via CV, for instance from an LFO is another interesting option
* (Digital) NOISE can give interesting results, especially with the WaveFolder and PhaseShifter
* When using digital sounds as input you may end up with high frequency aliasing, so adding a lowpass filter on output is suggested in this case
* You may consider using a long reverb on the output of LoFi-MultiFX as well

* If you are a bit familiar in programming, it should be easy for you to add your own combinations of the given effects by having a look at GrainsIO::process()
